.. note::
    Hail's How-To Guides are in their early stages. We welcome suggestions
    for additional guides, as well as feedback about our documentation. If
    you'd like to add a guide to the documentation, make a pull request!

These guides are short, goal-oriented explanations of how to use Hail.
